Benefits:

    Health-Conscious Choices: Users can make informed decisions about their food intake based on the provided nutritional information.
    Dietary Tracking: Helps individuals track their calorie intake and macronutrient consumption.
    Allergy Awareness: For individuals with dietary restrictions, the app can identify potential allergens within the food.

Future Enhancements:

    Expanded Database: Incorporate a larger database of food items to improve accuracy and coverage.
    Recipe Suggestions: Provide recipe suggestions based on the analyzed food item and user preferences.
    Personalized Recommendations: Offer personalized nutritional recommendations tailored to individual dietary goals and needs.
